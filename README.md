# SSP Flash Loader

This program flashes ITL firmware files to validator units over the SSP protocol.


## WARNING

`ssp-flasher` is in the very earliest stages of development. While all efforts have been made to implement the flashing protocol correctly, this tool is not "official" in any way, and not developed by ITL programmers.

Real-world testing and a more advanced test-suite is still required. Use at your own risk!

Please submit any bugs via an issue in the online repository, and/or open a pull request with the fix.

Contributions welcome!
